# Sales Input Summary

## Core Philosophy

A feminine sales funnel isn't about convincing or pushing - it's about **resonance, invitation, and recognition**.

**Flow:** Recognition → Trust → Relief → Invitation → Support  
No urgency. No pressure. No convincing.

## Positioning

### Masculine Framing (Old)
"I work on data extraction, automation scripts, and building AI solutions."

### Feminine Framing (New)
"I help vision-led entrepreneurs move from ideas and overwhelm into grounded, working reality - without the doubt, confusion, or technical friction."

## What I Do

Building digital products and helping people get access to useful information & guiding them through the process (beginner-, tech-, and brain-friendly).

I create systems that allow ideas to breathe, grow, and function - for entrepreneurs who want to move forward with ease, confidence, and clarity.
